📈 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄: AtliQ Hardwares has faced some tough financial challenges and relied on manual reporting, making it difficult to access quick, accurate insights for decision-making. They needed a solution to improve how they can view their financial and sales performance.

🔍 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 & 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀: To build this report, I used several tools and techniques:

𝗘𝗧𝗟 - Extracted, transformed, and loaded data
𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 - For efficient data transformation
𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗶𝘃𝗼𝘁 - To enhance data modeling
𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 - Created a clear model to connect sales and finance data
𝗗𝗔𝗫 𝗠𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 - Added key metrics and calculations
𝗣𝗶𝘃𝗼𝘁 𝗧𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀 - For easy data exploration and insights
𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 - Highlighted important trends and outliers

🎯 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁: The final report is divided into 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 and 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 and provides AtliQ with structured, timely insights that support data-driven & decision-making.
